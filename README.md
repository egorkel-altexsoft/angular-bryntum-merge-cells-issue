# AngularBryntumMergeCellsIssue

## How to run the demo

1. This demo uses thin packages of the Bryntum scheduler pro.
  Put npm tgz packages to the **src/assets/bryntum-scheduler-pro** folder.
  The list of required packages see in the package.json file.
  As an alternative you can use [bryntum guide](https://www.bryntum.com/products/scheduler/docs/guide/Scheduler/quick-start/angular#access-to-npm-registry) to install the packages.

2. Copy fonts **fa-solid-900.ttf** and **fa-solid-900.woff2** from the bryntum installed core package
  (**node_modules/@bryntum/core-thin/fonts**) to the **src/assets/fonts** folder.
